Hybrid Recommendation System
----------------------------

What is this?
- It is a helper that suggests fun events for people.
- It looks at what you like, what people like you enjoy, and what is popular now.

The data it reads
- users.csv: who the people are and what they like.
- events.csv: the list of events and their details.
- attends.csv: which users went to which events and when.
- follows.csv: which users follow which artists.
- artists.csv: info about the artists.

Three brains working together
1) Knowledge brain (profile match):
   - Matches your interests (like music or dance) and your region to event types and regions.
   - Gives each event a KnowledgeScore.

2) Graph brain (friends-of-friends):
   - Builds a network of users, events, and artists.
   - Finds users like you and recommends events they enjoyed.
   - Gives each event a GraphScore.

3) Trend brain (what is hot now):
   - Looks at recent attend data (last days/weeks).
   - Picks events that are getting more visits.
   - Gives each event a TrendScore.

The hybrid blender
- Mixes KnowledgeScore, GraphScore, and TrendScore.
- Uses different weights depending on how active you are:
  * New/cold user: trusts profile more.
  * Active user: trusts similar users more.
  * Trending focus: trusts the trend brain more.
- Creates a FinalScore and sorts events.

Explanations
- Each suggested event comes with a short reason, like:
  * "Matches your interests"
  * "Popular among similar users"
  * "Trending this week near you"

How to run (easy version)
- Make sure your CSV files are in the data/ folder.
- In a terminal, run:
  python run_recommend.py
- Pick a menu option:
  1) Hybrid (all brains together)
  2) Trend only
  3) Graph only
  4) Hybrid with custom explanations
- Enter a user id (for options that need it) and how many results you want.
- You will see a list of event ids, scores, and reasons.

What you can change
- Add more user interests or regions in users.csv.
- Tune the weights in the hybrid blender if you want a different mix.
- Change the time window for trends to be shorter or longer.

Remember
- The system does not change your CSV files; it only reads them.
- The better the data, the better the suggestions.
